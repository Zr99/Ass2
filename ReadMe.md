The Observer Pattern
--------------------

Programs are easier to understand and maintain if the
classes from which they are built each have clear responsibilities
and hide implementation details.
This project explores a program built using the 
observer pattern.  The goals are firstly to understand the ideas of
the pattern and its implementation, and secondly to look at the way
in which this allows each of the classes to function with minimum
knowledge of each other.

Java libraries include implementations of the observer pattern in a 
number of contexts, but for this
project I am making my own.
